There are two program

1) simulator.c
It is the multi-threaded program with graphic capabilities.
main thread: used for the graphic rendering and main program
file read thread: will read the file generated by traffic_generator program
queue process thread: will process the queue

Compile and run as
$ gcc simulator.c -o sim -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf && ./sim

This program uses the SDL2 (linux should work out of the box)
For windows follow the official instructions (https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation)
I have not tested the code on windows :-(.

2) traffic_generator.c
This program generates the traffic data and save into the vehicles.data file. This
file will be read by simulator to populate the traffice (queue)

Compile and run as
$gcc traffic_generator.c -o traffic_gen && ./traffic_gen


=============================
=============================


For those who are willing to use IPC (inter process communication) 
can use the traffic_generator2.c and receiver.c code as a reference and modify accordingly.

$ gcc traffic_generator2.c -o traffic_gen2 && ./traffic_gen2
$ gcc receiver.c -o rec && ./rec

These programs are highly depends on the system ipc and messaging protocol.

If your program not receiving the data check the ipc queue status using
$ ipcs -q
This should result some thing like below

------ Message Queues --------
key        msqid      owner      perms      used-bytes   messages    
0x000004d2 1          rughimire  666        0            0        


If your program stock you can restart the queue by using linux command
$ ipcrm -Q 1234
This will kill the existing queue.

For more command use manual.

The receiver2.c and traffic_generator3.c can be used as a reference code to enable network based communication.
This is also based on the Linux Network API.
For windows this program is not tested.

In this case, you have to follow the program run order. First the receiver2.c should be executed and then only run the generator.

$ gcc receiver2.c -o rec && ./rec

The server opens the port 5000 on the host machine and wait for the client to connect
IP: 0.0.0.0 means all the ip available to the server


$ gcc traffic_generator3.c -o traffic_gen && ./traffic_gen

The generator will connect the server using IP and port number.
127.0.0.1 => for connecting the server running on localhost.
